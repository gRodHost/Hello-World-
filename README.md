""" Hello,
I'm Rodney. I started as an IT student a few years ago and ended up here. I've learned HTML, CSS, and some javascript but never used it much and forget most of it. I've mainly used SoloLearn for learning syntax. Right I'm wanting to become familar with python and find some interesting things to do with that. I'm reading "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python", while learning everything I can about Linux, Open source software and general security.

Thanks for stopping. I hope everyone has a wonderful and productive day.
Rodney
